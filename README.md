## About

This repo contains my notes on an Ubuntu minimal install. I have 2 scripts to set up my machine after a minimal install. 
The first script sets up a barebones Ubuntu config with Rapoison WM and a few tools. 
The second script will set up more of the less urgently needed software and configure some of the usual settings needed after a clean install. I also aim to add all my notes (usually in .org format) on installing various software on Ubuntu such as Emacs, StumpWM, Conkeror etc.

## Files

- [`Install.org`](/Install.org) – Notes on how to run the install and how to run the barebones script after a minimal install.
- [`ubuntu-barebones.sh`](/ubuntu-barebones.sh) – The first file to run after the minimal install. It installs xorg and xinit and gets a barebones setup with Ratpoison as the window manager, xterm as terminal, Firefox as web browser and Thunar as file browser.
